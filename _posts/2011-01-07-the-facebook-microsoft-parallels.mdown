Interesting article about the similarities between Microsoft's 1986 IPO and Facebook's 2011 IPO both headed by Goldman Sachs. John Stewart had a good rant on last nights The Daily Show about [Glodman buying Facebook shares to by pass the SEC](http://watch.thecomedynetwork.ca/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart/full-episodes/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart---january-6-2011/#clip396371) (link will only work in Canada).

> Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Gates was dealing with uncannily similar issues to the ones facing Mr. Zuckerberg today. And Goldman was wooing Mr. Gates and his decade-old Seattle software company, Microsoft, in much the same way that it has romanced Mr. Zuckerberg and his fellow Facebook executives.
