Apple released [iWork](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/31iwork.html "Apple iWork Now Available For iPhone & iPod touch Users") (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) for the iPhone (and iPod Touch) today and coincidentally I had to write an actually print on a dead tree, lick a stamp, and put in an envelope letter.

It a decent enough word processor but I still prefer using [Elements](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/ "Elements - Dropbox powered text editor for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch from Second Gear") and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (I am now using [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) on my [Mac](http://www.iawriter.com/mac "iA Writer for Mac OS X") and [iPad](http://www.iawriter.com/ipad "iA Writer for iPad")).
