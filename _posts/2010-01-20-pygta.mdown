Last night at [PyGTA][1], [Mike][2] gave a short talk/demo about his
findings using [Tornado][3] and [CouchDB][4] to write a
real time chat and voting application for [his PyCon talk][5].

Tornado is a lightweight non-blocking web server created by
[FriendFeed][6] and Open Source by [Facebook][7]. The API is similar
to [web.py][8] and App Engine's [webapp framework][7]. Mike's ending comments was that Tornado can out perform Twisted. But
he found he had to write a lot of code to do things that were built
into Twisted (or any other modern web framework) already.

His thoughts on CouchDB:

> I'm really beginning to regret the choice of CouchDB for the
> back-end.  It's working perfectly well, but I have literally dozens
> of pieces of code hanging around for doing SQL-based paging... none
> of which are applicable to CouchDB.


*Referenced: [Things I'd like to play with (given enough time)][10]*

This website (and a few other sites I manage) will be moving from
[Apache 2][11] and [WSGI][12] to Tornado and [Nginx][13] [#][14]. It
will still be built on top of [Django][15] thought so most of the
issues Mike was talking about wouldn't apply to me.
