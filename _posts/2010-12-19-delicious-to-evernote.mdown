With the [sale/closure/whatever](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/ "Is Yahoo Shutting Down Del.icious?") of [Delicious](http://delicious.com/) you probably want to export your bookmarks. This AppleScript will export each bookmark (tags and notes) as a separate note in an Evernote notebook called "Delicious".

[Evernote's blog also has an interesting way to import](http://blog.evernote.com/2010/12/16/making-the-transition-from-delicious-to-evernote/ "Making the transition from Delicious to Evernote") your bookmarks by importing all your bookmarks into on note.
