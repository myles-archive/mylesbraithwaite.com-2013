<p><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is a note taking service that has clients for <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/windows.php">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/mac.php">Mac OS X</a>, <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and some other systems I don't use. Which is great but I doesn't support Linux.</p>

<p>The installation process is really simple just <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine" title="Ubuntu Community Documentation for Wine">install Wine</a> and download <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/windows.php">Evernote 3.1 for Windows</a> (not the beta). Next just type in <code>wine ~/Downloads/Evernote_3.1.0.1225.exe</code> and follow the normal installation process.</p>

<p>Evernote is really cool, but as you can see from the screen shot above, it doesn't look so good. But I am impressed though that Wine added the Tray icon to my Gnome notification area.</p>
