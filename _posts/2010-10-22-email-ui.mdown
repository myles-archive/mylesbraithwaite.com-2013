### An Email from Panic

I signed up for [Transmit's Beta](http://www.panic.com/blog/2009/12/transmit-beta-signup/) and it looks like they had a lot of people signed up and now the Beta program is full. So they sent me an email informing me:

### Lighthouse strange UI

I started using [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/) (a ticket tracker) a few days ago for [Asgard](http://asgardproject.org/ "Asgard Project"), [iDelicious](http://i-del-icio-us.appspot.com/ "An iPhone interface for Delicious), and a few other personal projects (while I wait for a new server to run [Jira](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/)). Initial thoughts are it a really good, simple, easy to use ticket track. But as you can see from the screenshot below I always forget where the *Add new Ticket* button is located. I look left under the bar that has a bunch of *New* actions but I start freaking out because I don't see *New ticket*, then I remember to look right where their is a prominent button that say *Create new ticket*.
