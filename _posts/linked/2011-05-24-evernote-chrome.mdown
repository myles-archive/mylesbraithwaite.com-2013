[Evernote](https://www.evernote.com) has updated their [Evernote Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc) to have a lot more awesome.

I use Evernote for pretty much everything that is a document on my computer. From some stuff I find [inspirational](http://www.evernote.com/pub/myles/inspiration "Evernote Shared Notebook for Inspiration") to [recipes](http://www.evernote.com/pub/myles/recipes "Evernote Shared Notebook for Recipes").
