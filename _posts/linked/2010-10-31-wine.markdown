> Inspired by attempts to make Wine‘s theme match the Human theme in Ubuntu, I tried to write a script to scrape colors from Gnome and apply them to Wine automatically, so the themes match no matter what theme you’re using in Gnome. (Of course it would be best to have actual theme support, but current implementations are uselessly slow.  Matching the color scheme is a good start, and might be a useful component of real theme support anyway.)
