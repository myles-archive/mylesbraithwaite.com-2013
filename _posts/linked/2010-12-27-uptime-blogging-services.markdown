Looks like [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) really does suck as a blogging services. But more interesting individual blogs on all services have different uptime.

> **Not all blogs are created equal, even within the same blogging service.** Downtime can vary significantly between blogs on the same service, presumably depending on which servers the blogs are hosted on. Itâ€™s a similar situation to that of shared hosting, where you can end up on servers that perform worse than others for various reasons.
