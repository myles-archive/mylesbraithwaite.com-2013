Scoble has an intresting article on why MySpace lost the social networking market to Facebook was largly due to their choice of using Microsoft based technologies and the fact they were in a location that didn't have a large amount of programmers.

> The problem was, as Myspace started losing to Facebook, they knew they needed to make major changes. But they didn’t have the programming talent to really make huge changes and the infrastructure they bet on made it both tougher to change, because it isn’t set up to do the scale of 100 million users it needed to, and tougher to hire really great entrepreneurial programmers who could rebuild the site to do interesting stuff.
