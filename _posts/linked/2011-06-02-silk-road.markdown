An interesting article about how the illegal drugs has moved to the Internet. Using technologies like [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/ "Bitcoin a P2P Virtual Currency") and [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/ "Tor Project") you can have an almost anonymous transaction of illegal items. But as Jeff Garzik (a core developer of the Bitcoin project) says:

> He explains that because all Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public log, though the identities of all the parties are anonymous, law enforcement could use sophisticated network analysis techniques to parse the transaction flow and track down individual Bitcoin users.
> 
> "Attempting major illicit transactions with bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement, is pretty damned dumb," he says.
