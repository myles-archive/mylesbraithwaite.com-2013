An other reason why 37signals is such a smart company:

> So instead of going for the land grab, we created a small island. We priced Draft at $9.99 -- significantly higher than most of the products [on the App Store]. The people who buy Draft know exactly why Draft is valuable to them. And they think $9.99 is a fair price.
