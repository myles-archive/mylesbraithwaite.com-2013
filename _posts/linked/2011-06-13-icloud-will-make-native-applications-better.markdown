> Appleâ€™s vision of the cloud makes native apps better. Others see the cloud as a substitute for native apps.

I keep thinking of the ways the iCloud file storage API will help with native applications on iOS and OS X. Seeing what having a [Dropbox](http://db.tt/poQioUw) can do for mobile development something full interagted with the OS is pretty cool.

## Update

Just so you know Apple didn't copy Dropbox for this feature, they copied Ubuntu One and CouchDB.
