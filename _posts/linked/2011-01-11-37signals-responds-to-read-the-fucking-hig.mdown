[Read the Fucking HIG](http://readthefuckinghig.tumblr.com/) is a Tumblr blog of the worst applications in the Mac App Store. HIG stands for [Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html) a document Apple puts out on how to design your iOS and Mac applications. Though this is a great document for a company to put out (check out [Gnome](http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/), [KDE](http://developer.kde.org/documentation/design/ui/), and [Windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx) guidelines) HIGs usually are not followed by a majority of application markers (include the companies that write them (just look at the new iTunes)). It only the Java-based and Open Source applications that actually adhere to the HID.
