[Greg Wilson][GregWilson] on [What We've Learned From Building Basie][PyCon112] -- what a bunch of undergraduates accomplished building a [Django][Django]-based replacement for Trac called [Basie][Basie]. [Mike C. Fletcher][MikeFletcher] on [Debating 'til Dawn][PyCon111] -- will be presenting some of the best discussion/ideas/talks at [PyGTA][PyGTA] the last three years in his attempt to make [PyCon][PyCon] cool again.
